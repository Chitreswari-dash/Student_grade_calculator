The Student Grade Calculator is a simple Java program that helps students calculate their final grades based on their scores. 
It takes input for multiple subjects, calculates the total and average marks, and assigns a grade based on predefined criteria. 
This tool makes it easy for students to evaluate their performance without manual calculation.
Using the application is simple—enter the marks for different subjects, and the program will calculate the total, 
average, and corresponding grade. If you’d like to improve the program or add features like file storage or a graphical interface, feel free to contribute!
